# glassintel.com website code
This is the repository for glassintel's website source code.

I code nearly everything from scratch. I reserve the right to accuse anyone of using my work without my permission. If you like my code and want to use some of it, by all means, shoot me a message or an email.

Want to contribute? glassintel.com is not currently looking for any new developers, but if you feel you have something of importance, I again encourage you to contact me.
